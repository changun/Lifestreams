Lifestreams
===========

Lifestreams is a data analysis stack designed to runs on top of an existing mobile data collection system. The Lifestreams stack consists of four layersâ€”feature extraction and aggregation, feature selection, inference and visualization. Each layer consists of modular plugins or building blocks that can process the data provided by the lower layer, and then send the result to the next layer up in the stack.
